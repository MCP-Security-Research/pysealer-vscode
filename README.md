# vurze extension for Visual Studio Code

A Visual Studio Code extension with support for the vurze cryptographic signature tool

Vurze helps you maintain code integrity by automatically adding cryptographic signatures to your Python functions and classes. Each function or class receives a unique decorator containing a cryptographic signature that verifies both authorship and integrity, making it easy to detect unauthorized code modifications.

## Usage

Vurze will automatically install this extension when you initialize a vurze project by running `vurze init` in your project directory.

If you want to disable Vurze, you can disable this extension per workspace in Visual Studio Code.
